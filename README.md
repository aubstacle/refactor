# REFACTORING HOMEWORK

I hope you enjoy my refactored webpage! I have changed quite a bit; by consolidating many of the unneccessary/repetitive div classes (like "online-reputation-management" and "social media marketing" for example) I have tacked off nearly 70 lines of CSS code!! 

I've also replaced some of the more generic divs with specific semantic elements like section, header and footer.

In short, I have essentially cleaned up as much of the HTML classes as I believe possible, while in turn cleaning up the stylecheet by consolidating and correctly linking the new/edited corresponding CSS elements.
