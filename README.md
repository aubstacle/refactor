# REFACTORING HOMEWORK

I hope you enjoy my refactored webpage! I have changed quite a bit; by consolidating many of the unneccessary/repetitive div classes in the HTML file (like "online-reputation-management" and "social media marketing" for example), I've made the html more specific and concise, and as a result I've deleted nearly 70 lines of unneccessary CSS code!! 

I've also replaced some of the more generic div tags with specific semantics like section, or in some cases replaced div classes with generic tags like header and footer.

In short, I have essentially cleaned up as much of the HTML as I can, while in turn cleaning up the css stylesheet by consolidating or deleting unecessary classes and correctly linking new or edited corresponding ones.
